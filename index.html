					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
					<h3>The Purpose of This Guide</h3>
					<p>This guide will take you through Petfinder's API and will teach you how to access its data for your own application. We will begin with some example applications to give you ideas of how the API can be used and why you might want to learn how to use it. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand what the API is, how to set it up, how to send a request, and how to interpret the data you will be receiving. You will soon be on your way to using the Petfinder API for your own application! I will be breaking down each part of the official documentation found on Petfinder's website and will cover it in detail below; but if you would like to take a look at it first, you can find it by clicking the button below.</p>
					<a href="https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs" class="button special">Official Petfinder API doc</a>
					<br><br>
					<p>Before beginning this tutorial, it is necessary that you have a basic understanding of Javascript, jQuery, and HTML. There are many great online resources if you are unfamiliar with either of those. I would strongly recommend checking some of them out before returning to this API guide.
					<br><br>
					A few great Javascript tutorials that I would recommend are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">W3Schools' JS tutorial</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics">Mozilla Developer Network's JS tutorial</a>.
					As for HTML tutorials, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">W3Schools</a> also has a great tutorial, as does <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. And finally, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp">here</a> is a great jQuery tutorial also by W3Schools.

				<h2>What are APIs?</h2>
				</header>
					<p>API stands for Application Programming Interface and it serves as an interface between different programs, allowing them to communicate and interact with each other. Programmers make APIs to give developers access to their data and resources. For a more comprehensive definition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Wikipedia </a>has a great explanation of APIs.</p>
					<p>And for visual learners, here is a FANTASTIC animated answer to the question "What is an API?"

				<h2>What does Petfinder's API do?</h2>
				</header>
					<p>Petfinder has over 300,000 adoptable pets and over 11,000 animal welfare organizations in its database. Using its API, developers can access the entire database to display Petfinder's data on their own dynamic websites or applications. Petfinder's API has nine methods that can be used to pull data such as a breed list, shelter records matching your search, pet records matching your search, a single pet record, and so on. There are two methods that I will not be mentioning in this guide: (1) the method auth.getToken for obtaining a token, and (2) the method shelter.get that returns a record for a single shelter and requires the use of a token.</p>

					<h2>Let's Get Started</h2>
				</header>
					<p>To access any information from Petfinder's database, you must first obtain an API key. An API key is a unique code used to identify the calling program, the developer, or the user. It is passed in by computer programs when an API is called and can track how the API is being used. If the API is being used maliciously or the terms of service are being violated, the user can be tracked down and the license can be revoked. Take a look at Petfinder's API Terms of Service before obtaining your key.</p>
					<a href="https://www.petfinder.com/api-terms-of-service/" class="button special">API Terms of Service</a>
					<br><br>
					<h3>How To Get a Key</h3>
					<p>Before you can obtain a key, you must create an account with Petfinder.com</p>
					<a href="https://www.petfinder.com/user/register?next=https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key" class="button special">Register</a>
					<br><br>
					<p>Great! Now that you are logged in, you can request an API key. When you arrive at the page, just fill in the fields, read the terms, check the box that says "I have read and agreed to the terms of service", and click the orange button to request a key!
					<br><br>

					<br><br>
					</p>
					<a href="https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key" class="button special">Get an API Key</a>
					<br><br>
					<p>If you have successfully obtained a key, you will be directed to a page "For Developers" where you can view your API information. Your API Key will be shown along with your API Secret. The secret is used to sign requests that require authentication. We will not be using the secret in this tutorial, but it is there if you need it down the road. The page will look like this:

					<h2>Sending a Request</h2>
				</header>
					<p>Okay, now for the good stuff! Let's learn how to send a request. The Petfinder API is a RESTful API, meaning it is accessed using standard HTTP request methods. For GET calls, the arguments are specified in a URL query string that will look something like this:
					<br><br>
					"http://api.petfinder.com/my.method?key=12345&arg1=foo&token=67890&sig=abcdef"
					<br><br>
					The "token" and "sig" arguments are not needed for most of the methods and will not be needed for any of the examples covered in this guide. However, it is good to know where to append the information should you want to use it later.
					</p>
					<p>Here is some sample code for what a request for Breed List might look like:</p>
					<img src = "images/sampleBreedRequest.jpg"/>
					<br><br>
					<h3>Breaking Down the Request</h3>

					<h3>The Breed List Request and the Result</h3>
					<p>Now that you understand how the request came together, go ahead and click the "Result" tab to see the result:</p>

					<h2>Interpreting the Response</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The result that was returned is an object, so we do not need to parse the data. If we received data in JSON format, we can parse it to convert it into a JavaScript Object. JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is based on a subset of the JavaScript language. In the example above, I took the object that was returned and converted it into JSON string using "stringify" so that we can see what the returned data looks like. As you can tell, it is hard to read and not very useful to us yet. There is a handy tool that can be used to format the result into something a little more readable. All you have to do is paste your JSON result into the box on the left, click the "Format/Beautify" button, and you will get something that looks like this:</p>
				<img src ="images/formattedJSON.jpg"/>
				<p>However, if you want to display this information on your application, we still have some work to do. Since the data was already returned in an object, we can use dot notation to access and display the data. Here is what the edited code now looks like:</p>
				<img src ="images/displayBreedList.jpg"/>
				<p>Now the breed list is displayed on your webpage in a list!</p>
				<img src="images/breedListDisplayed.jpg"/>
				<h3>Let's Break it Down</h3>
				<p>breaaaak down how to display
				<br>We can take a look at the returned object its data by using the developer tools on the Chrome browser. Click on the "Console" tab and you will see a collapsed tree that looks like this:
				<br>
				<img src="images/collapsedTree.jpg"/>
				<br><br>
				Go ahead and expand the object tree. Click on the arrows next to "Object" -> "petfinder" -> "breeds" -> "breed" -> "[0 ... 99]" -> "0" . You will now see the breed "Affenpinscher"! You have just expanded the tree to access the first breed name. You should be seeing this:
				<br>
				<img src="images/extendedTree.jpg"/>
				</p>
				<p>Now that I've broken it all down and you understand how it all comes together, here is the entire chunk of code in JSFiddle:
